  <h1> Welcome to the apps!!!</h1>
  <div> App1: BusCart Analytics </div>
  <div>
  -updateBusCart: allows user to update a part of a buscart
</div>
<div>
  -analyticsBusCart: shows % full of part of bus cart for all three floors
</div>
<div>
  -statusBusCart: Lists the current Bus Carts' status' (Red, Yellow, Green)
</div>
<div> -extensions could include capturing total time a status of "Red" is there, allowing a Caddie's shift to be quantifiably judged as well as a "closing" scheduler so that bus carts in the dish pit would be timed to increase efficiency and vibes </div>
<div>  </div>
<div> App2: Birthday MTM Coordinator  </div>
<div> -createBirthday: Adds birthday to Queue </div>
<div> -currentBirthdays: Shows Current Birthdays, can update Status as well </div>
<div> -extensions would require coordinating with kitchen on how to time desserts as well as with managemnt on schedluing the singing teams and stuff</div>
<div> Other possible app ideas i've had: </div>
<div> -Shelf Space optimization calculator(determing optimal square footage allocation
  for storage space for food items based on temp, delivery availability, demand) </div>
  <div> -Bar Drink monitor (build a "smart bar" with scales underneath each alcohol bottle
    ) </div>
    <div> -Bay Host Scheduler: (optimize the wants of the most possible
      bay hosts for their schedules) </div>
<div> TG Specific Stuff: </div>
<div> -Create a Digital Preshift </div>
<div> -With Angry Birds, the auto launch button should have a "left" "center" or "right" option
cause the kids can see right through that auto launch when it doesn't go the right way</div>
<div> -GoTab needs to allow for the process to still order food when the QR code is scanned when teal </div>
<div> -GoTab needs to allow people to add sides to the grilled chicken sandwhich </div>
<div> -The game system should have a timer that if the guest doesn't hit yes or no to extend
it eventually turns yellow after like 5 mins to notify bay host of inactivity </div>
<div> -In theory adding an RFID reader to the Orange ball carts could give warnings to bays
aiming directly at them consistently</div>
<div> -The game should have a limit on how many balls can be dispennsed once the time is down to like 5 mins </div>
<div> -Golf Swing analyzer: analyze someone's golf swing, give them tips on it </div>
<div> -Club distance analytics: create game mode that divides balls up by clubs so platnium
members could see their progress overtime per club with distances and consistency and shit</div>
